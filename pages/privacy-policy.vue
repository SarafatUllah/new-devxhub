          Use of Customer Information
        </h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-7 pb-4">
          Customer privacy is something we take very seriously at DEVxHUB. We do
          not sell or disseminate (except in cases where required to by law
          enforcement agencies) the personal information of our customers to any
          parties outside of DEVxHUB or its subsidiary companies, for any
          purpose other than communicating messages provided by DEVxHUB. We use
          customer information for the purposes of creating and maintaining
          individual customer accounts, contacting customers in case of problems
          with their account(s), sending personal information, for statistical
          purposes, to administer our systems, to conduct surveys, to administer
          drawings or contests, to provide product and marketing updates, and to
          provide technical support.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base leading-7">
          DEVxHUB may engage with companies or agencies that may come in contact
          with some customer data only in cases where that access is required to
          support DEVxHUB’s own goals and initiatives. Some optional partner
          offers and services may require customer information to be provided to
          third parties as a necessary part of establishing service with them.
          Please note that the contact information that you provide to us is
          used to register your domain name and is, by the very nature of the
          domain registration system, available for public viewing in many
          places on the Internet via the use of the ‘whois’ tool.

          Whois Privacy Services
        </h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-7">
          Whois Privacy as offered by DEVxHUB does not act as a shield from
          legal liability in conjunction with Domain Registration. In order to
          preserve neutrality in disputes between 3rd parties and domain
          registrants, DEVxHUB will act in accordance with ICANN Registrar
          Accreditation agreement section 3.7.7.3 upon receipt of actionable
          evidence of illegal activity. This means that identifying information
          will be provided to law enforcement and officials of the court
          including attorneys as situations require in order preserving
          DEVxHUB’s neutrality in any litigation.
